        "This tutorial demonstrates how to read and process X-ray images with NumPy, imageio, matplotlib and SciPy. You will learn how to read medical images, focus on certain parts, and visually compare them. X-ray image analysis can be part of your data analysis and [machine learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235291481930214X) workflow when, for example, you're building an algorithm that helps [detect pneumonia (on Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge). In the healthcare industry, medical image processing and analysis is particularly important when images are estimated to account for [at least 90%](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/51146.wss) of all medical data.\n",

        ") dataset provided by the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://nih.gov). ChestX-ray8 contains over 100,000 de-identified X-ray images in the PNG format from more than 30,000 patients. You can find ChestX-ray8's files on NIH's public Box [repository](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) in the [`/images`](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/37178474737) folder.
